WordPress and Ghost are powerful platforms. They power a huge portion of the web, and for good reason. But for many individual writers and creators, they are overkillâ€”a sledgehammer to crack a nut. The hidden cost is "tech debt," a slow accumulation of complexity that eventually grinds your productivity to a halt.

Let's break down the real-world differences between a traditional CMS and this simple, file-based system.

### Feature & Philosophy Comparison

| Feature             | WordPress / Ghost                                | This Markdown System                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Performance**     | Slow. Depends on database, caching, & hosting.   | **Instant.** Pure HTML files served from a CDN.    |
| **Maintenance**     | *Constant.* Plugin updates, security patches.    | **None.** No database, no server-side code to patch. |
| **Content Ownership** | Trapped in a database. Requires complex export.  | **Total.** Your posts are simple `.md` text files. |
| **Cost**            | Can be high. Hosting, premium themes, plugins.   | **Free or near-free.** Host on Netlify, Vercel, etc. |
| **Security**        | A major target for hackers. Requires vigilance.   | **Extremely secure.** No entry points to attack.    |
| **Writing Experience**| Often a clunky, web-based block editor.        | **Pure bliss.** Use your favorite text editor.       |

### What is "Tech Debt" for a Writer?

For a writer, tech debt isn't about code; it's about friction. It's...
- The hour you spend trying to fix a broken plugin instead of writing your next post.
- The hesitation to change your site's theme because you're afraid it will break everything.
- The monthly hosting bill that makes you question if your blog is "worth it."

A file-based system has virtually zero tech debt. It's just your words, beautifully formatted, delivered to your readers at the speed of light.
